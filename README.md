## Overview

This project focuses on developing two AI agents to play a small version of the Go game called Go-5x5 or Little-Go. The game is played on a reduced board size of 5x5, and the AI agents are based on different AI techniques for Search, Game Playing, and Reinforcement Learning.

The two AI agents are as follows:

1. **Minmax Alpha-Beta Pruning Player:** This AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make informed decisions and optimize its moves during gameplay.

2. **Q Learning Player:** This AI agent is based on the concept of Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique. It learns to play the game by exploring and updating its Q-values based on rewards received during gameplay.
